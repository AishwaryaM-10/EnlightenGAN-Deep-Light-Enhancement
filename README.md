# EnlightenGAN: Deep Light Enhancement

This repository contains an implementation of **EnlightenGAN**, an unsupervised GAN-based model for low-light image enhancement. The project demonstrates how deep learning can enhance image visibility without paired supervision.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Low-light conditions often result in poor image quality. This project applies EnlightenGAN to enhance such images using a data-driven, unsupervised generative adversarial network.

### ✨ Key Features

- End-to-end unsupervised learning using GANs
- Works without paired low-light and normal-light image datasets
- Generator and discriminator architecture as proposed in the EnlightenGAN paper
- Visual comparison of enhanced outputs vs. original inputs
