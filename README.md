# EnlightenGAN: Deep Light Enhancement Without Paired Supervision

This repository contains an implementation of **EnlightenGAN**, a GAN-based unsupervised model for enhancing low-light images. The model leverages deep learning to improve image clarity and visibility without requiring paired low-light and normal-light training images.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- End-to-end unsupervised learning using GANs
- Works without paired low-light and normal-light image datasets
- Generator and discriminator architecture as proposed in the EnlightenGAN paper
- Visual comparison of enhanced outputs vs. original inputs

## üîç Project Summary

In this project, we successfully explored and implemented an image enhancement model focused on improving image quality through various testing and evaluation metrics.

The model effectively processes images, handles edge cases, and meets performance expectations for memory usage and inference time. We addressed the limitations of previous methods by integrating additional layers‚Äî**LIME** and **GAMMA**‚Äîwhich significantly reduced issues like:
- Color distortion
- Noise
- Overexposure

These enhancements enabled better illumination correction and contrast boosting, delivering **natural and visually appealing results** across a variety of lighting conditions.

## üìä Evaluation

The model was rigorously evaluated using key image quality metrics:

| Metric | Value (Avg) |
|--------|-------------|
| PSNR   | 14          |
| SSIM   | 0.9         |
| NIQE   | 0.7         |

- **LIME and GAMMA layers** were pivotal in handling extreme cases.
- Results validated robustness and high-quality enhancement across standard and edge-case scenarios.
- Inference time and memory usage remained within optimal limits.
